# jc-imaging-portfolio

This is where I am experimenting with HTML, CSS & Javascript to create a portfolio website of my radio imaging work

Very much a work in progress

Started this project in May 2021, left on a personal cloud to never see the light of day. 
Learning about Git therefore uploading to Github
